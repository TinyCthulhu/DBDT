# DBDT
This is the public part of the DBDT project repository.

DBDT is an effort in combining dozen of tools I've used and/or created in one (hopefully) useful package.


Currently, the application functionality includes, but is not limited to:
* access, data browsing, SQL query executon for interbase / firebird databases. 
* importing, browsing and preparing data for database injections from CSV (or similar, character delimited text files) and excel (xls, xlsx) data sheets  
and other stuff... 

## Remarks
Please note that, this is an after-hour project maintained on spare time so it's development probably won't be as rapid as I'd like it to be.

## Contribute
If you found a bug or you have a proposed enhacement you can fill an issue in issue tracker.
