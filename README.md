# DBDT
This is the public part of the DBDT project repository.

DBDT is an effort in combining dozen of tools I've used and/or created in one (hopefully) useful package.


Currently, the application functionality includes, but is not limited to:
* access, data browsing, SQL query executon for interbase / firebird databases. 
* importing, browsing and preparing data for database injections from CSV (or similar, character delimited text files) and excel (xls, xlsx) data sheets
and other stuff... 

Please note that, this is an after-hour project maintained on spare time so it's development probably won't be as rapid as I'd like it to be.
